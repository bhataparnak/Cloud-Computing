  Sample Things to do 
  
 1. Show a web page and interface (which resides on the cloud provider) with your name,
     and below that, Student ID at the top of every web page dispayed

    Import the datasets into a Relational Data Base (SQL), if you have already done this, (briefly) explain/describe
    how you did this. Please note that for some parts of the following you will need to create indexes (keys)

  2. Allow a user, through a web form, to give a nst range (for example 80 to 85), and show us the matching result tuples
     for that request. (Show nst, lat, long, place, mag, id)
     Show us the time taken to perform that operation



  3. Allow a user to give a nst range (for example 80 to 85), and you will generate a random select within that nst range,
     select all quakes with that nst value, show us the result, as in the previous question.
     Show us the nst value generated, then show the results.
     Show us the time taken to perform that operation.


     
  4. Modify part 3, to allow a value N (up to 500), and repeat the selections N times.
     

  5. Repeat 4. using an in-memory caching mechanism (NOT an in-memory database) repeat the previous step, then show us
