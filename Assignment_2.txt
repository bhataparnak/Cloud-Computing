  Sample Things to do

  1. Show a web page and interface (which resides on the cloud provider) with your name,
     and below that, Student ID at the top of every web page dispayed 
     (for this quiz). Please use a large font.
    
     The cloud service provider is either IBM Cloud (BlueMix) or Microsoft Azure.

     On that same page, allow a user to give an id value (such as "ak020921jc6m"), then please show 
     the details of that quake (if it exists), location (lat, long, place name), mag, time, depth.
     If there are any other quakes with the same mag (same mag plus or minus 0.1 mag), please list
     those as well.

  2. (Web page) Allow a user to give two location (pair) values (lat and long for two different locations) 
     (those two locations create a boundary, a box) and a depth range (for example from 2 to 20),
     then: display the 3 largest mag quakes within that (bounding) box, please display the id, location (as above),
     the mag, and time.

  3. (Web page), Allow a user to give a part of a location name (for example "Yellowstone" or "Alaska"), 
     and a depth range (for example from 2 to 200), and a distance (for example 550 km), 
     and show the largest magnitude quake (if one exists), within that distance.
     Note, that there may be several locations in Alaska within that given depth range, 
     so list the largest mag quake for each.Please display the lat, long, mag, place, depth and date for each.
   
  4. Allow a user to give two location (pair) values (lat and long for two different locations) 
     (those two locations create a boundary, a box), and a value N, then: 
     display the N largest mag quakes within that (bounding) box, (display lat, long, place, mag, time and id)
     then allow a user to choose any of those quakes (displayed) and modify any of the values: 
     lat, long, place, mag, time and id.
