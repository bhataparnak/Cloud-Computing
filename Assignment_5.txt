  Sample things to do
 
  1. Documents l.txt and h.txt are written by the same person. But they were about very different subjects,
     and are different lengths. Still, one way to compare is the frequency usage (percent, fraction) of each word, 
     that is, of the total count of all words in the document, what fraction are word "X" (what percent)?
     (For every word in each document, what fraction of THAT document is each word.) 
     Show the N most frequent words (percent), where we will give you N on a web form, for each document.
     (Remember to change letter cases and remove punctuation, they are not part of words.)

  2. Take the list of stopwords given, and remove all those stopwords from both texts. 
     Show the total number of words removed from each, then show the remaining texts, 
     then repeat the previous question.

  3. On a web page allow a user to give two words, for example "public health", which is a bigram.
     Using the orginal texts (but still dealing with case, punctuation),
     Find all occurances of the given two words (bigram) where they are adjacent, with no words between them.
     Please list all sentences that contain those bigrams.
