Sample things to do with Highcharts
  
  1. Please show a page, followed by a vertical bar chart on that page, where the user, through a web form, 
     will give a country name (column C), then you will display a bar chart with labels (volcano name) 
     on the top of each bar for each volcano in that country.
  
  2. Allow a user, through a web form, to give a volcano number range (for example 40000 to 41000),
     and show a point chart (scatter diagram) where the X axis is the volcano number and the Y axis 
     is the elevation.
     (Please note that a few of the volcanos are under water or ground, so the elevation may be negative.) 
     Please scale so that it fits on the screen, occupying between 70 to 80% of the screen width.
     Please label both axis.
